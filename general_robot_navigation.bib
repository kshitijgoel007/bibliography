  abstract = {In this letter, we introduce the Log-Gaussian Process Implicit Surface (Log-GPIS), a novel continuous and probabilistic mapping representation suitable for surface reconstruction and local navigation. Our key contribution is the realisation that the regularised Eikonal equation can be simply solved by applying the logarithmic transformation to a GPIS formulation to recover the accurate Euclidean distance field (EDF) and, at the same time, the implicit surface. To derive the proposed representation, Varadhan's formula is exploited to approximate the non-linear Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE) of the EDF by the logarithm of a linear PDE. We show that members of the Mat\'ern covariance family directly satisfy this linear PDE. The proposed approach does not require post-processing steps to recover the EDF. Moreover, unlike sampling-based methods, Log-GPIS does not use sample points inside and outside the surface as the derivative of the covariance allow direct estimation of the surface normals and distance gradients. We benchmarked the proposed method on simulated and real data against state-of-the-art mapping frameworks that also aim at recovering both the surface and a distance field. Our experiments show that Log-GPIS produces the most accurate results for the EDF and comparable results for surface reconstruction and its computation time still allows online operations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a fundamental algorithm, called VDB-EDT, for Euclidean distance transform (EDT) based on the VDB data structure. The algorithm executes on grid maps and generates the corresponding distance field for recording distance information against obstacles, which forms the basis of numerous motion planning algorithms. The contributions of this work mainly lie in three folds. Firstly, we propose a novel algorithm that can facilitate distance transform procedures by optimizing the scheduling priorities of transform functions, which significantly improves the running speed of conventional EDT algorithms. Secondly, we for the first time introduce the memory-efficient VDB data structure, a customed B+ tree, to represent the distance field hierarchically. Benefiting from the special index and caching mechanism, VDB shows a fast (average \textbackslash textit\{O\}(1)) random access speed, and thus is very suitable for the frequent neighbor-searching operations in EDT. Moreover, regarding the small scale of existing datasets, we release a large-scale dataset captured from subterranean environments to benchmark EDT algorithms. Extensive experiments on the released dataset and publicly available datasets show that VDB-EDT can reduce memory consumption by about 30\%-85\%, depending on the sparsity of the environment, while maintaining a competitive running speed with the fastest array-based implementation. The experiments also show that VDB-EDT can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art EDT algorithm in both runtime and memory efficiency, which strongly demonstrates the advantages of our proposed method. The released dataset and source code are available on https://github.com/zhudelong/VDB-EDT.},
