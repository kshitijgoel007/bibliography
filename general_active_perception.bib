  abstract = {In this letter, we present an interactive probabilistic mapping framework for a mobile manipulator picking objects from a pile. The aim is to map the scene, actively decide where to go next and which object to pick, make changes to the scene by picking the chosen object, and then map these changes alongside. The proposed framework uses a novel dynamic Gaussian Process (GP) Implicit Surface method to incrementally build and update the scene map that reflects environment changes. Actively the framework computes the next-best-view, balancing the terms of object reachability for picking and map information gain (IG) for fidelity and coverage. To enforce a priority of visiting boundary segments over unknown regions, the IG formulation includes an uncertainty gradient-based frontier score by exploiting the GP kernel derivative. This leads to an efficient strategy that addresses the often conflicting requirement of unknown environment exploration and object picking exploitation given a limited execution horizon. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with software simulation and real-life experiments.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an online informative path planning approach for active information gathering on three-dimensional surfaces using aerial robots. Most existing works on surface inspection focus on planning a path offline that can provide full coverage of the surface, which inherently assumes the surface information is uniformly distributed hence ignoring potential spatial correlations of the information field. In this paper, we utilize manifold Gaussian processes (mGPs) with geodesic kernel functions for mapping surface information fields and plan informative paths online in a receding horizon manner. Our approach actively plans information-gathering paths based on recent observations that respect dynamic constraints of the vehicle and a total flight time budget. We provide planning results for simulated temperature modeling for simple and complex 3D surface geometries (a cylinder and an aircraft model). We demonstrate that our informative planning method outperforms traditional approaches such as 3D coverage planning and random exploration, both in reconstruction error and information-theoretic metrics. We also show that by taking spatial correlations of the information field into planning using mGPs, the information gathering efficiency is significantly improved.},
